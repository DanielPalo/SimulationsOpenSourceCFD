This tutorial performs a steadyState incompressible simulation for an aerodynamic carshape
The aim of this tutorial is to show an automatic simulation starting from a CAD (step file) to a complete CFD.
The preProcessing of SALOME CAE is written in python3 the rest of code in bash language. 
Software Requested: 
0) python3 
1) Salome CAE 9.2.1
2) openFOAM-6 
3) paraView with python compiled (coming soon)

The stl are generated with SALOME and mesh with SnappyHexMesh the simulation with SimpleFOAM
The possibility to link SALOME and OpenFOAM, two powerful openSource softwares, is main goal of this tutorial. 
Furthermore this link can lead to a major automation and speed-up in the CFD process.
