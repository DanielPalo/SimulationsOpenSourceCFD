This tutorial performs a steadyState incompressible simulation for an aerodynamic carshape
The aim of this tutorial is to show an automatic simulation starting from a CAD (step file) to a complete CFD.
The preProcessing of SALOME CAE is written in python3 the rest of code in bash language.
Software Requested: 
0) python3 
1) Salome CAE 9.2.1
2) openFOAM-6 
3) paraView with python compiled (coming soon)

The stl are generated with SALOME and mesh with SnappyHexMesh the simulation with SimpleFOAM
